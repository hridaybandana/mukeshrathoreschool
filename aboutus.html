                    to provide quality education that balances academic excellence with strong moral values.
                    What began as a modest institution with a small group of students has steadily grown into a
                    well-recognized school serving learners from <strong>Class I to Class X</strong>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Over the years, the school has continuously evolved by adopting modern teaching
                    methodologies while preserving traditional values of discipline, respect, and
                    responsibility.
                </p>

                            The strength of Mukesh Rathore School lies in its <strong>dedicated and diverse team
                                of staff members</strong>, who work together to create a safe, disciplined, and
                            inspiring learning environment.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The school is led by an experienced <strong>Principal</strong>, whose leadership
                            focuses on academic excellence, student welfare, and continuous improvement. The
                            Principal’s cabin remains open to students and parents for guidance, suggestions,
                            and addressing concerns.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our <strong>teaching faculty</strong> consists of trained and passionate educators
                            specializing in their respective subjects. Teachers focus not only on syllabus
                            completion but also on concept clarity, creativity, and individual attention.
                            Regular workshops and training sessions help them stay updated with modern teaching
                            techniques.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The school is supported by skilled <strong>laboratory assistants</strong> who ensure
                            safe and effective practical learning in science and computer labs.
                            <strong>Physical Education (PT) teachers</strong> and <strong>Yoga instructors</strong>
                            guide students toward physical fitness, discipline, and mental well-being through
                            structured activities and daily practice.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Equally important are our <strong>non-teaching staff</strong>, including peons,
                            administrative staff, and the cleaning department. They play a vital role in
                            maintaining cleanliness, safety, and smooth day-to-day operations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Together, the entire team works with dedication, empathy, and professionalism to
                            support students in their academic journey and personal growth.
